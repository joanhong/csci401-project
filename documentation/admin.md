### User Management
- This page displays the full list of admins, stakeholders, and students.
- The list of users can be filtered by user type.
- Each user can be deleted or have their information edited.
- An admin can add new students and admins by entering their emails on this page. A registration link is sent to these emails and they are permitted to register as users on the platform.

### Project Proposals
- This page displays the complete list of projects submitted by stakeholders with their status, min and max group size, and description .
- Each project can be approved, rejected, or have changes suggested for it.

#### Project Matching
- This page runs the project matching algorithm and assigns students to projects based off the student rankings.
- The admin first enters the number of choices that they wish the project matching to consider. For example, if the admin enters "5," the top five ranked choices of each student are considered.
- By hovering over each student, their top choices can be seen.
- Students can be manually dragged to different projects.
